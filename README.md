# Greetings App

When the user enters their name into the text field and clicks the "Say Hello" button, the `showGreeting()` function is called. This function retrieves the value of the text field, constructs a personalized greeting, and displays it on the page.

Note that this is a very simple app and there are many ways to improve it. For example, you could add error handling if the user doesn't enter a name, or you could use a more sophisticated templating library to construct the greeting.
